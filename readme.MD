The file getCSV.xlsx was my attempt at making Excel read data from the serial monitor in the form of text and numbers, and output the data directly to a spreadsheet.

It's not fast.

Data collection rates faster than 1 data point per second should probably be avoided.
It's also a bit glitchy, so I offer this spreadsheet without apologies. Be warned!
On the other hand, it did work on Mac and PC the last time I tested it.
